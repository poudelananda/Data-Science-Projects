# Topic-Modeling-NLP
Main goal for the project is to make sure that we identify the proper topics from the text data webscraped from apple forums and identify time intervals for those topics. 
To receive the proper topics we ran a double LDA approach. This meant tbat we would run our LDA model on each consumer questions of our dataset (which we received from the apple forum), 
then run another iteration of LDA on each of those topics to get the most significant topics overall.
